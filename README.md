# Explanation

Alright ... so ... this mod is probably a little out-there. Bear with me. Here's the deal.

Let's talk about some more violent methods of prisoner management.

You can beat them, y'know? Just hit 'em for a while. Until they can't walk. That'll prevent mental breaks and prison breaks.

But you don't wanna slice 'em in half with your plasma sword. You just wanna punch 'em. With your fists. You can do this in vanilla. But you gotta tell your pawn to drop their weapon on the ground first. And you gotta remember to tell your pawn to pick it back up when they're done. That's annoying. So we add our first feature, a new widget: "Unarmed attack". This is just like "Melee" attack, except they don't use their weapon, they do it as if they were social fighting, and also you can issue the order when they're not drafted, and they'll go back to something else when it is finished, instead of standing there drafted like idiots. Just like "Melee", they only stop if/when the target becomes downed. This is also very useful and convenient against your own Berserk colonists.

Also, uh, if you're beating prisoners, you wanna probably keep going sometimes (even when they're downed) as long as they can take it, but you also probably wanna stop sooner other times. Like, before you kill them (for prisoners you're not recruiting), or before you destroy any parts at all (for prisoners you're recruiting). You can do this in vanilla. But you gotta laboriously watch the "Health" tab of the target, watch for any parts that get damaged below 12 or so, and stop them. That's really annoying to do manually. So we add our second feature, another widget: "Beat". This one is like "Unarmed attack", except they will keep going when the target is downed, but instead stop before killing them (for prisoners you're not recruiting) or before they destroy any parts at all (for prisoners you're recruiting). Conveniently, your pawn doing the beating will also stop early to protect their own limbs, like if they take a lucky punch to a finger, so they don't lose it to another punch. (Fingers and toes aren't a problem once you're on artificial hands/limbs.)

Finally, once the beatings are done, your prisoners are going to lay there nicely downed and controlled for a while. But they'll eventually heal back up, and you wanna beat 'em again. It is annoying to remember to keep checking this. So we add our final new feature: A designator "Beat", that you can put on prisoners, and a checkbox in the Work tab "Beat". For any pawns with this Work checked, for any prisoners with the "Beat" designated, the pawns will automatically come back and beat them again, as soon as they're able to (per the above limitations on when to stop).

I personally suggest, for your colonist doing the beating, to replace their jaw with a denture, so they don't bite anybody, and don't cause infections. But that's your choice.

The result is a truly deranged method of prisoner management. And you could technically do all of this in pure vanilla RimWorld. We don't technically change any behaviors. We just make it easier and more convenient to be the war criminal you've always wanted to be.
